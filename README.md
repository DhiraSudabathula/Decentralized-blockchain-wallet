      <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
      <p>A rise has occurred in the adoption of mobile systems across the globe in the past few years. Even so, poor internet connectivity in rural regions still hinders the adoption of such technologies. In the other hand, Security risks continue to present challenges for the adoption of these technologies. Furthermore, a decentralized wallet on the Internet Computer Protocol blockchain authorize effortless transactions and token management while enhancing Security. We are building a safe and decentralized wallet using the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) blockchain. This paper introduces a Blockchain based wallet system that provides a secure mobile payment service.This wallet will make transactions easy and help users manage their tokens efficiently. Users will have the ability to create accounts, manage their wallets, monitor balances, and perform deposits and withdrawals, all while taking advantage of ICP’s smart contract functionalities. This wallet is created to work independently of third-party payment processors as a result of strengthening decentralization and security. Currently hosted in the local ICP environment, the wallet is set to transition to live deployment through the burning of cycles. The development environment is established using Ubuntu WSL, promoting efficient development practices. Our strategy eliminates intermediaries, lowers costs, and enhances the user experience.</p>
      <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
      <p>
  Blockchain was first introduced as the underlying technology of Bitcoin.A blockchainn is a distributed database shared among nodes on a computer network. They are best known for playing an important role in cryptocurrency systems, maintaining asecure andd decentralized record of transactions of control, and transfers of ownership and information from one party to another (individual, organization, or group). Blockchain technology is designed to be decentralized, tamper-resistan t, and traceable. A smart contract is a scenario-based promise specified in a programming language on the blockchain. Here, running a smart contract on the blockchain can be calledsending a transactiontion to the blockchain peers and executed in isolation for every peer. The last step is wherthe contractct execution is completed and the result is also returned to the blockchain.

   Decentralized is not a new concept. When constructing a technology solution, there are three types of network architectures that are mostly weighted out, such as centralized architecture, distributed architectur,e and decentralized architecture. Rather, decentralization is a sliding scale that should be applied to every facet of blockchain concept. By decentralizing the management of and access to resources in an application, accurate service can be achieved. Decentralized networks are mostly used by blockchain technologies. Decentralization generally comess with some tradeoffs in terms of throughput, but in an ideal world, these tradeoffs are eclipsed by the higher stability and service levels that they produce.</p>
